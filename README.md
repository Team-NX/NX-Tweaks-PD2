This mod provides some quality of life changes to improve your game experience (:

## Features:

### Disable Shaped Charges During Stealth

> By default, after equipping 'Trip Mines & Shaped Charges' you notice that the high interaction range of the Shaped Charges often interferes with Lockpicking, which was quite infuriating to me.

### Civilians: Distinguish Detection
### Civilians: Display Intimidation

> these settings are related, since they both change how the detection icon for civilians look.
> "Distinguish Detection" changes the red exclamation icon when civilians detect you to an orange empty check-box
> "Display Intimidation" changes the red exclamation to a blue checked box to show that a civilian is intimidated/pacified

### Mute out of Focus
(Experimental, please report any problems to me <3)
> Like many other games, alt-tabbing out of the game will mute the game until you focus it again
